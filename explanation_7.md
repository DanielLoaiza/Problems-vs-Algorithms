## HTTPRouter using a Trie
This is a practical use of a trie, the idea is to find the handler for a given route, this trie has some specific implementations as for example remove additional slash at the end to find a route or add not found handler if the route is not found, the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n)
