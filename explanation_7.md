## HTTPRouter using a Trie
This is a practical use of a trie, the idea is to find the handler for a given route, this trie has some specific implementations as for example remove additional slash at the end to find a route or add not found handler if the route is not found, the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) for the insert operation since we need to store the entire path on an map, the find operation has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity since no additional data is stored
