## Dutch National Flag Problem

This problem was solved similar as how its solved pivot switching on quicksort, since we know that if we have 0s and 2s sorted on their positions 1 will be sorted too, so the idea is to reference current positions where new 0s and 2s should be placed and and switch positions with the current index. the time complexity is O(n)
